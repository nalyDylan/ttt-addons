# Chat Tags
Quick clientside only script that checks if a user is in a ULX group and changes the color of their name in that based on the group. I'm not a big fan of adding more clutter to chat, but, people wanted this so here it is.

This is a rewrite of someone else's much older script that used a ton of if's and string concatenation to do this. Since GMod has at some point changed to accept varargs for chat.addText, we just shove everything in a table and pass it up
